# Hash Maps / Dictionaries

## Introduction
A hash map (dictionary) is a data structure that stores key-value pairs for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion.

**Example in Dart:**
```dart
Map<String, int> scores = {'Alice': 90, 'Bob': 85};
print(scores['Alice']); // Output: 90
```

## Key Properties
- Fast lookup, insertion, deletion: $O(1)$ (average case)
- Keys must be unique

## Common Use-Cases
- Caching
- Counting frequencies
- Fast data retrieval

## Interview Insights
Hash maps are used in problems involving duplicates, frequency counting, and fast lookups.

## Practice Problems
- Find duplicates in an array
- Find the intersection of two arrays
- Two sum problem
