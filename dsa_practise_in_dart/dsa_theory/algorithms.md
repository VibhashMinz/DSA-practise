# Algorithms

## Introduction
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing tasks. Key algorithmic techniques include sorting, searching, recursion, and dynamic programming.

## Sorting
- Bubble sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort

## Searching
- Linear search
- Binary search

## Recursion
- Solving problems by breaking them into subproblems

## Dynamic Programming
- Optimizing solutions by storing results of subproblems

## Interview Insights
Algorithms are the backbone of problem solving and optimization in coding interviews.

## Practice Problems
- Implement bubble sort
- Implement binary search
- Fibonacci sequence (recursion & DP)
- Longest increasing subsequence
