# Graphs

## Introduction
A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected.

**Example in Dart:**
```dart
class Graph {
  Map<int, List<int>> adj = {};
}
```

## Key Properties
- Nodes and edges
- Can be cyclic or acyclic

## Common Use-Cases
- Social networks
- Pathfinding algorithms
- Network routing

## Interview Insights
Graphs are used in problems involving traversal, connectivity, and shortest paths.

## Practice Problems
- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Detect a cycle in a graph
