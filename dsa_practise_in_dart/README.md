# DSA Basics for Frontend/Mobile Developers

## What are Data Structures?
Data Structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently for access and modification. Common types include:

- **Array**: Fixed-size, ordered collection of elements.
- **Linked List**: Sequence of nodes, each pointing to the next.
- **Stack**: LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structure.
- **Queue**: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) structure.
- **HashMap/Dictionary**: Key-value pairs for fast lookup.
- **Tree**: Hierarchical structure (e.g., binary tree).
- **Graph**: Nodes connected by edges.

## What are Algorithms?
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing tasks. Examples:

- **Searching**: Find an element (e.g., linear search, binary search).
- **Sorting**: Arrange elements (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort).
- **Traversal**: Visit all elements (e.g., tree traversal).
- **Recursion**: Function calling itself to solve subproblems.

## Why DSA Matters for Frontend/Mobile?
- Efficient data handling (lists, search, filters).
- Optimized UI rendering (virtual DOM, diffing).
- Fast response to user actions (autocomplete, search).
- Interview questions often test DSA basics.
